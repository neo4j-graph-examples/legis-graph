== FEC Import

One of the benefits of using a graph database is the ability to combine data from multiple datasets into the graph. In this exercise we'll import data from the Federal Election Commission into our graph of US Congress to examine data on donations to legislators re-election campaigns.

== Understanding how data load works

Be sure you've loaded the data from US Congress in the previous step. Our goal is now to import FEC data using this data model:

== Exploring the raw data

You can just have a look at the first few rows of your csv file without actually doing any data load.

We'll use a subset of the filing data available from the FEC website. We have three flat files:

. `cm.txt` - data definining FEC Committees (such as election campaigns, PACs, etc)
. `ccl.txt` - a file linking FEC Committees to the candidates they fund (legislators in our case)
. `itcont_sm.txt` - a file containing data on individual contributions to a FEC Committeee, one row for each contribution. This file contains 10,000 contributions from the 2016 election season.

Let's explore the data available in each file. As you examine the data availabe in the flat files, consider the following:

. What should be modeled as a node?
. What are the relationships?
. How can we link the two datasets?

==== cm.txt

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}cm.txt" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|"
WITH row limit 10
RETURN row
----

=== ccl.txt

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}ccl.txt" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|"
WITH row limit 10
RETURN row
----


=== itcont_sm.txt

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}itcont_sm.txt" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|"
WITH row limit 10
RETURN row
----


== Exercise

Now that's you've had a taste of importing data using `LOAD CSV` your task is to import the FEC data.

You'll need to write at least three `LOAD CSV` statements to iterate through each CSV file:

== Add FEC Committee nodes

image::{img}/fec-dm.png[]

First we'll create a node for each FEC Committee. Let's use the label `FECCommittee` for these.

What property will uniquely identify an FEC Committee node? Create a uniqueness constraint for this label, property pair to ensure no duplicates are created:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON ... ASSERT ...
----


[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}/cm.txt" AS row ... // remember how to set the field terminator?
WITH row
MERGE (f:FECCommittee... // what property uniquely identifies the FEC Committee?
ON CREATE SET ...
...
----

== Link candidates to FEC Committees

image::{img}/fec-dm.png[]

Now that we h

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
USING PERIODIC COMMIT
// Read from the CSV file that links candidates to committees
... AS row FIELDTERMIANTOR '|'
MATCH (c:FECCommittee) WHERE ... // Look up the FECCommittee for this row`
MATCH (l:Legislator)  WHERE ... // How can we find the Legislator for this row?
MERGE ... // Create a relationship connecting the Legislator and the FECCommittee indicating this FECCommittee is funding the Legislator's reelection campaign
...
----


== Individual contributions

image::{img}/fec-dm.png[]

We have data about contributions made by individuals to FEC Committees. How should we model these contributions?

Let's add these contributions to our graph:

=== The Individual Contributions File

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}itcont_sm.txt" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|"
WITH row limit 10
RETURN row
----

=== Import Individual Contributions

Next we need to create the nodes and relationships for each contribution:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "{csv-url}itcont_sm.txt" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|"
...
----

// == Adding FEC data

// These queries won't actually work because the data has already been loaded, but this shows how you can load CSV data into Neo4j.


// === Add FEC Committees
// [source,cypher]
// ----
// // FEC Committees
// USING PERIODIC COMMIT
// LOAD CSV FROM "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67572426/fec/cm.txt" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|"
// WITH row
// //WITH replace(row[0], "[", "") AS committee
// MERGE (c:FECCommittee {committee_id: replace(row[0], "[", "")})
// SET c.name = row[1],
//     c.designation = row[8],
//     c.committee_type = row[9],
//     c.committee_party = row[10],
//     c.category = row[12]
// WITH row WHERE row[2] IS NOT NULL
// MERGE (t:Treasurer {name:row[2]})
// CREATE UNIQUE (t)-[:TREASURER_FOR]->(c);
// ----

// === Link candidates to committees
// [source,cypher]
// ----
// // Link candidates to committees
// USING PERIODIC COMMIT
// LOAD CSV FROM "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67572426/fec/ccl.txt" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|" WITH row
// MATCH (c:FECCommittee) WHERE c.committee_id = row[3]
// MATCH (l:Legislator) WHERE l.fecIDs CONTAINS toString(row[0])
// CREATE UNIQUE (c)-[:FUNDS]->(l);
// ----

// === Individual contributions to committees
// [source,cypher]
// ----
// // Individual contributions to committees
// USING PERIODIC COMMIT
// LOAD CSV FROM "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67572426/fec/itcont.txt"
// AS row FIELDTERMINATOR "|"
// WITH row WHERE row[7] IS NOT NULL AND row[12] IS NOT NULL AND row[11] IS NOT NULL AND row[8] IS NOT NULL AND row[9] IS NOT NULL
// MATCH (c:FECCommittee) WHERE c.committee_id = replace(row[0], "[", "")
// CREATE (con:Contribution {sub_id: replace(row[20], "]", "")})
// SET con.amount = toFloat(row[14]),
//    con.date = row[13]
// CREATE UNIQUE (con)-[:MADE_TO]->(c)
// MERGE (t:Contributor {name: row[7]})
// MERGE (occupation:Occupation {name: row[12]})
// MERGE (employer:Employer {name: row[11]})
// MERGE (city:City {name: row[8]})
// MERGE (state:State {code: row[9]})
// CREATE UNIQUE (t)-[:MADE_CONTRIBUTION]->(con)
// CREATE UNIQUE (t)-[:HAS_OCCUPATION]->(occupation)
// CREATE UNIQUE (t)-[:WORKS_FOR]->(employer)
// CREATE UNIQUE (t)-[:LIVES_IN]->(city)
// CREATE UNIQUE (city)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(state)
